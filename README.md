### Hej hej!

I'm Michael, a .NET and JavaScript (TypeScript is more enjoyable though) and upcoming Swift/iOS developer.

I'm always open for new projects, ideas, opportunities or just to talk! You can see my portfolio (albeit slightly barren and unpolished, but I'm an engineer not a designer get off my back 😛) over here at [mikkelzu.github.io](https://mikkelzu.github.io). There you can find my contact details and other amazing things that are definitely worth checking out 😃

Anyway, back to work! Hej då!
