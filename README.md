### Terve!

MÃ¤ olen Mikku (tai Mikki).

I'm a Finnish/Dutch software engineer. Currently employed at [BigMile](https://www.bigmile.eu) as a full stack engineer.

I use mostly TypeScript and Next.js for frontend development and Go for fast and performant backend tasks, CLI tools.

I will say, Go is a superior language to TS. There, I said it. Fight me.

Anyhow, if you are interested in collaborating or want any advice contact me by sending a message on Github or join the [discord](https://discord.gg/sjuAavPyQt) for my open source cli project.

I am a certified LinkedIn hater - very rarely do I check LinkedIn so that isn't something I recommend trying to contact me through.

moikka!

Mikku
